## Sales Approach & Scripts

```
Subject: Partnership Opportunity - Save 20% on Certified Translations

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from Legacy Translations. We work with [similar businesses
in their industry] to provide fast, certified document translations at
wholesale rates.

I noticed [their firm name] serves clients who likely need translated
documents for [USCIS applications / tax filings / loan applications].

We're offering select partners:
✓ 20% off all translations
✓ Net 30 billing (no payment per order)
✓ 24-hour turnaround
✓ 100% USCIS acceptance guarantee

Would you have 10 minutes this week to discuss how this could benefit
your clients?

Best regards,
[Sales Rep Name]
```

### Follow-Up Script (After Initial Interest):

```
Great to connect, [Name]!

```

### Objection Handling:

**"We already have a translator"**
> "That's great! Many of our partners keep us as a backup for rush orders
> or overflow. Our 24-hour turnaround has saved many firms when deadlines
> are tight. Would a backup option be valuable?"

**"Your prices seem high"**
> "I understand cost is important. At $19.99/page with our partner discount,
> we're actually 30% below market rate for certified translations. Plus,
> there are no hidden fees - that includes certification, notarization,
> and digital delivery."

**"We don't have enough volume"**
> "No minimum required! Even 1-2 documents per month qualifies for partner
> pricing. Many firms start small and grow. Can I set up your free account?"
